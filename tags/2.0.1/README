Estats-userland provides a library and tools for the Web10G project.

http://web10g.org/

Estats-userland uses the standard autotools setup; to build, run

./configure
make
make install

By default, the libraries are installed in /usr/local/lib, so one may need to run
"ldconfig" after verifying that /usr/local/lib is listed in /etc/ld.so.conf;
for installation to other locations, use the --prefix arg to configure (cf. INSTALL).

To build the Python module, run configure with --enable-python, and set your
PYTHONPATH appropriately, e.g.

export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages


Basic tools and examples are in util/C.

All material here is based on the NSF supported projects, Web100 and Web10Gig.
