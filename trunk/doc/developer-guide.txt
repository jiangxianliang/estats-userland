                            Web10G Developer's Guide
                            ------------------------

Introduction
============

This is the Developer's Guide for the Web10G library API.  The
companion document, "User's Guide", provides a quick overview of
the Web10G software.

This document provides examples and suggestions for those interested
in writing applications using the estats library API. This is an
alpha-level release of the API, and there will certainly be tweaks
in subsequent releases, however, the basic form is presumed stable,
so that future modifications necessitated at the application level
should be minor.  Application programmers may rely on the library
API for development, though may want to familiarize themselves with
issues at the level of the kernel API; for this, one should refer
to the document proc_interface.txt to be found in

	 /usr/src/linux/Documentation/estats

after installing the Web10G patch.

Overview of the Primary Objects in the Library
==============================================

As mentioned in the User Guide, the estats software has added a
number of variables or "Instruments" to the kernel "sock" structure
which track a number of critical events on each of the TCP connections
on the system.  The primary goal of this library is to enable
developers to mointor and tune these variables.  These variables
are exposed to the outside world through the /proc file system.

The list of variables that are monitored can be found in the file

    /proc/web100/header

We highly recommend that you read the "proc_interface.txt" document
referred to in the pargraphs above for full details about the format
of this file.  Please see the document "tcp-kis.txt" for a detailed
description of the variables and what they measure.

As mentioned in proc_interace.txt, it should be observed that the
variables are grouped in one or more files, which are referred to as
"group"s in the estats library API.  The API provides routines for
reading a single variable, or a group of variables.  The advantage of
reading the variable as a group is that when the values of the
variables are read as group, all the values in that group are read
atomically.  This operation is called a "snap", and there are routines
provided to get "snapshot"s of groups.

The kernel API consists of a few essential data structures, and a good
understanding of these data structures is very helpful in writing estats
applications.  A brief overview if these data structures is provided
below:

   Agent - estats_agent

      Agent is the top most object of the library, and any estats 
      application developed using this library starts off by obtaining 
      a pointer to this object.

      This object contains a list of "connection" objects and "group"
      objects.

   Connection - estats_connection
      
      This is an object identified by a Connection ID (CID) that is set
      up by the kernel, one for each TCP connection on the host.  For each
      TCP connection on the system estats creates a directory

	  /proc/web100/<cid>

      where cid is a unique number.

   Group - estats_group

      A group is a collection of estats "variable" descriptors.  A group
      has a name which shows up as file in /proc/web100/<cid> directory.  
      By having access to a group, one can read all the variables in that
      group atomically.

   Variable - estats_var
     
      A variable is descriptor that contains the name of the variable
      and the necessary information to get its value from the kernel.

   Snapshot - estats_snapshot

      A snapshot contains a connection, a group, and all the values
      for that combination of connection and group at a particular
      time.

The hierarchy of the objects is as follows:

    Agent
       Connection		- the directory /proc/web100/<cid>
       Group			- the file      /proc/web100/<cid>/<group>

    Group
       Variable			- a descriptor pointing into
				  /proc/web100/<cid>/<group>
    Snapshot
       Connection
       Group
       Data for this group and connection				  
      
The library contains access functions to obtain pointers to these structures.
Please see the header file estats.h for the list of available routines.
Please consult the man pages for details about a particular routine.

Expample Code Illustrating the Use of the Library
=================================================

The use of the estats library is explained with the help of two simple
examples, readvar and HelloWeb10G.  Other tools and utilities provided
with the distribution should help you understand the library usage
once you have gone through these examples.

readvar:
This is the simplest example illustrating the use of the estats library.
What is included here is the stripped down version of the actual code,
readvar.c, included in the distribution.  All the error checking code
has been removed for clarity;  please see the code in the distribution
for complete details.

This example code takes 2 arguments, a connection ID and the name of a
Web10G variable, as its arguments and prints the value of that
variable for that connection.

You can choose a connection ID by getting a listing of directories in
the directory "/proc/web100" and selecting one of the numbered
directories.  It should be noted that these directories are transient,
and may disappear once the TCP connection associated with that CID
is closed.

You can choose a variable name by doing:
 
   more /proc/web100/header

and selecting variable from the list.

/*** End HelloWeb10G.c ***/

Explanation:

The code starts off by getting a pointer to an agent by doing:

    agent = estats_attach(ESTATS_AGENT_LOCAL,NULL);

Currently ESTATS_AGENT_LOCAL and ESTATS_AGENT_LOG are the only agents
supported.  Logging functionality of the library is described in a
later section.  Since this agent contains the list of connections and
groups, a pointer to a connection object of interest is obtained by
doing:
      
    conn = estats_connection_lookup(agent, cid);

where "cid" is a directory in /proc/web100 for the connection we are
interested in.

Since the agent contains the group list (a linked list), processing
starts off by picking the first group and processing all the variables
in that group, and then proceeding to the next group.

Processing of a group involves the following steps:

   - Allocate memory for a snap with              estats_snapshot_alloc
   - Reading all the variables in the group with  estats_snap

It should be noted that unlike reading one variable at a time, taking
snap gets the values of all the variables atomically at one instant
and stores them as a snapshot.

Once the snapshot is taken, the values are printed out one variable
at a time.  Since the value are already stored in snapshot, the values
are read out of the snapshot using estats_snap_read.

For additonal examples of estats library code, please look at the following
files:

	readvar.c - reads out the selected variable from the selected
		    connection.

	deltavar.c - prints out delta of a selected variable by taking
	             a snapshot every second.

Logging functionality of the estats library:
============================================

In the process of network performance testing there are times when the
length of the tests can be quite long.  These tests produce a lot of
information, and it may not be practical to analyze all the
information while the test is running, and it is often times necessary
to go back and look at different combinations of variables.  The
logging functionality of the library enables you to do this.

Typically, there is one data collection run where a log file is written,
and then at a later time, the data from this log file may be analyzed
multiple times.

The basic structure of the logfile is shown below:

    header			   (a copy of the /proc/web100/header)
    date/time of log created
    group-name
    connection-spec
    snap1
    snap2
    ...

The logging functionality is provided with the help of the estats_log
structure and its associated functions.  The estats_log structure 
(and the log file) are specific to a particular group and connection.
So if you wish to log two groups of variables, you would have to open
one log file for each group, though typically only the "read" group
is the group that is saved in a log file for post processing.

Using the logging functionality of the library is best illustrated
with a simple example.  In the example below, we will only elaborate
on the logging aspects of this example.

Once we have an agent, group, and a connection (as illustated in the
simple examples above), a log file is opend for writing with:

    log = estats_log_open_write("logtest.txt", conn, group);

then anytime a snapshot for this particular combination
of group/connection needs to be written out, it written out
with:

    estats_log_write(log, snap);

once all the snapshots are written out, the log file is closed
with:

    estats_log_close_write(log);

This is the end of process of creating a log file.  In typical
applicatioins one would not normally write a log file and read it
in the same execution, but that is what is being is done here for
illustration purposes.

The second half of the program illustrates the process of reading
a log file, which is fairly self explnatory.
